            <h1>History</h1><br>

            <pre>
            At the outset, there is nothing significant about the year 1721, as far as India's political history is concerned. 
            Aurangzeb, the sixth of the great Mughals, had passed away in 1707, and the Empire he and his forefathers had built,
            had started to disintegrate. The Marathas were gaining in prominence, and in the process of knocking hard on the 
            doors of Delhi. These were prominent happenings; what was peripheral was that 'merchants' from England and France 
            had established 'settlements' in select areas of the subcontinent, and were going about their business of trade.

            The sea-route being the sole link between them and their respective homelands, most of these settlements were 
            situated in the coastal areas of the Indian peninsula.

            It was sometime in 1721 that a British ship dropped anchor off the coast of Kutch in western India. The
            recreational activities the sailors indulged in on the coast elicited curious reactions from onlookers. 
            One of the sailors, who answered to the name of Downing, recalled his time on the Kutch coast in his 
            memoirs thus: "We everyday diverted ourselves with playing cricket and other exercises"

            This is the earliest recorded reference to cricket in India.

            As the merchants metamorphosed into rulers, they continued to demonstrate their recreational pursuits 
            on Indian soil. The British army took on the English settlers in what was the first recorded cricket 
            match in India in 1751.

            The establishment of the Calcutta Cricket Club (what we know today as CC & FC) in 1792, was another 
            watershed for the sport in the land. In fact, it is the second-oldest cricket club in the world, 
            after the MCC (1787).
